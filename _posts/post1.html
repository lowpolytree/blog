                <h1>Project Updates</h1>
    <p>
        Since I don’t work on any game-related stuff anymore, I thought I’d start sharing other things I’ve been working on. As I’m trying to change domains, there is quite a bit of day-to-day learning happening behind the scenes, which also made me think about how to learn efficiently, etc. For the most part, I’m going with the project-based approach, specifically a bite-sized project-based approach to keep things moving and not end up in a slump.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, the first thing I did was switch from Windows to Linux as my primary machine. I started with Ubuntu but switched to Fedora early on. I had issues with Nvidia drivers on both Fedora and Ubuntu, but I managed to solve them on Fedora, and hence, I stuck with it. I’m very happy with it now. Fedora rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second thing I thought I’d do was to force myself to use the command line for most things. It turns out Linux is simply built around the command line, and it’s a much more straightforward experience than on Windows. So at this point, two months later, I went from using no command line to using it every day. In fact, it’s my preferred way to do most stuff on Linux. Yeah, weird.

        For learning networking, I’m using the guides for CompTIA Network+ and for Linux, some Udemy courses and <em>How Linux Works</em> by Brian Ward. But of course, none of that is worth much unless you apply it in projects. Here’s what I’ve done so far, starting from the easiest to more involved:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Set up a basic firewall:</strong> UFW in my case, which stands for Uncomplicated Firewall. True to its name, it’s indeed uncomplicated. You just turn it on, and it works. It can be configured for one’s needs, but basic settings work for the average user.
            <br><em>Troubleshooting:</em> Not much, I changed the logging from low to mid and enabled it to start on boot (it doesn’t by default).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Capturing packets with Wireshark:</strong> I spent some time familiarizing myself with Wireshark and what it can do since it might come in handy eventually. It’s a great tool to peek inside IP packets and see the TCP/IP model in action.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Set up a basic "Hello" webpage using Apache:</strong> Not much to it—just followed the instructions from ChatGPT and browsed the docs. Right now, it’s only accessible through my private IP address. I was looking into hosting it publicly, but this goes beyond a basic project as you need to know how to secure it properly, and that’s a whole other project entirely.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Set up a separate local network for homelabbing:</strong> I got an extra TP-Link router on Prime Day specifically for that purpose. Now I have a local network I can play around with.
            <br><em>Troubleshooting:</em> Routers nowadays work out of the box, so the only thing I did was change my new router’s gateway from 192.168.0.1 to 1.1 so it doesn’t overlap with the other one.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Turning Raspberry Pi into a NAS:</strong> This felt like an actual project, and it took me a few days to get it to work, but once I did, it felt great. NAS stands for Network Attached Storage, and on Amazon, they cost hundreds of bucks. But I’ve wanted to tinker with Raspberry Pis for a while now, and NAS is one of the projects they even have listed on their website.
            <br><em>Troubleshooting:</em> There was a lot initially. It turned out the microSD card that came with the kit was faulty, which resulted in fatal errors when trying to apt install anything. Thankfully, I’m a USB hoarder, so all the issues were solved after I switched. Another issue was that my local network is not connected to the internet (intentionally), and I had to look into SSH tunnels and using a proxy to redirect traffic and all that new-to-me stuff so I could update through my Fedora. Then into Samba and Avahi for mDNSing, but it’s all done and working and accessible through all of my local devices. The only issue is that I don't have much to store there for now.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Some random stuff I did for housekeeping:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Set up automatic backup of my Obsidian notes with rclone and systemd timer to Google Drive.</li>
        <li>Made an encrypted database for my passwords using SQLCipher and SQLite.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I have an active interest in automation, but for now, I also work on automating stuff that can be immediately useful to me. And I only do it on weekends. :D
    </p>
    <h2>My Next Projects:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Set up a VPN using Outline (I’m trying a VPS from Hetzner right now, not sponsored.)</li>
        <li>Learn more SQLite and Apache/web stuff through mini projects like BookTracker, etc.</li>
    </ul>
